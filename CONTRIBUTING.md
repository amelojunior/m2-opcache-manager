## Check open Issues
Please check if a feature/issue is already taken care of by a other contributer. Perhaps you both can work on an issue / feature. The important part is that we do not waste time.

## Branches
Base your fork of our development branche and create PR's to the development branche. If you want you can always request your own feature branche.

## Honor code styles
Try to follow coding standards in general; safe, secure, logical and those of PHP & Magento.
